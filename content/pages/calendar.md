This schedule shows the reading you should have done by a given day: it's designed to spread your reading fairly evenly across the semester (e.g if four class sessions are devoted to a novel, you should read **at least** a quarter of the novel for each of those sessions). In class, however, I'll go slower over some parts, faster over others. The schedule is subject to change, so if you miss a class, check to make sure what's coming next.
